      <p>Hey there! My name is Rich Pasqualone. I'm a 26 year old musician with a budding interest in coding and web development.</p>

      <p>I've been interested in this field for awhile because of the many possibilities that it holds. Working with new tech, working from afar, and being able to use the creative part of my brain all come to mind.</p>

      <p>I work very well in a group, am commited to the tasks that I've been given, and have a strong sense of work ethic. All of which are things that I expect to and look forward to using in my future career.</p>
